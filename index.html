        <small>What is Dark Crystal?</small>
        <p>Dark Crystal transforms secrets into crystal shards that you can send to trusted friends. If you lose the secret, or something happens to you, your friends can combine the shards to recover the crystal and reveal the secret.</p>
        <p>Dark Crystal uses <span class="note">cryptography<sup>1</sup></span> so that no individual shard reveals anything about your secret on its own. Your secret is only revealed if the people you chose cooperate and put their shards together.</p>
        <div class="notes"> 1. Until modern times, cryptography referred almost exclusively to encryption, which is the process of converting ordinary information (called plaintext) into unintelligible text (called ciphertext). Decryption is the reverse, in other words, moving from the unintelligible ciphertext back to plaintext. A cipher (or cypher) is a pair of algorithms that create the encryption and the reversing decryption.</div>

        <p>Use Dark Crystal for....</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Passwords</li>
          <li>Cryptocurrency seeds &amp; keys</li>
          <li>Directions to the hidden treasure</li>
          <li>Any other secret in text form</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Dark Crystal is a decentralised peer-to-peer app, meaning you exchange shards directly with your friends. No data is sent through a central server. It even works when you're not connected to the internet.</p>

        <p>With decentralised and encrypted tools, there's no company or authority who can reset your access. Security is all on you. Using Dark Crystal makes managing your keys and passwords a little bit more forgiving, while still being very secure.</p>

        <p>Dark Crystal is built on the Secure Scuttlebutt protocol. Find out more here: <a href="https://www.scuttlebutt.nz">www.scuttlebutt.nz</a></p>

        <p class="center">In P2P spaces, your friends are the data center. Data get wiped? Resync it from your friends. Lose your private key? Piece together the shards from your friends. That radical interdependence with real people that we trust can remove our dependency on corporate cloud providers. This feels important; an undoing of decades of capitalist efforts to isolate us and separate us from each other. P2P technology can help people reconnect with each other on a human beings level. <a href="https://twitter.com/noffle">@noffle</a></p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <div class="inner">
        <div>
          <p><strong>Why should I back up my secrets using Dark Crystal?</strong></p>
          <p>Humans aren't perfect, and life happens. Sometimes you forget a password, or your computer gets stolen, or your password manager gets corrupted, or you get hit on the head by a coconut and fall into a coma. Some systems, especially decentralised cryptographic ones, aren't very forgiving in these situations. But simply giving your keys or passwords to someone else isn't secure. Dark Crystal backs up your secrets securely with friends who can help you recover them, without ever sharing the secret itself.</p>

          <p><strong>Sharding (aka Shamir's Secret Sharing) isn't new. What makes Dark Crystal different?</em></strong></p>
          <p>While sharding technology has been around for a long time, it hasn't been widely adopted. We think that's because the process is complicated, difficult, and error-prone. Dark Crystal makes it much simpler and more user-friendly. If more people use sharding successfully, fewer secrets will be lost unintentionally.</p>

          <p><strong>Why did you make Dark Crystal?</strong></p>
          <p>We want to make cryptocurrency accessible and user-friendly. We are excited about a crypto-powered future, and it's important everyone gets to participate. We talked to a lot of people to find out what parts of using cryptocurrency are hard and key management was on top of the list! We found existing sharding tools very painful to use and we knew we could make something better.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p><strong>Is Dark Crystal open source?</strong></p>
          <p>Yes! Check out our <a href="https://github.com/blockades">repo(s)</a> on github...</p>

          <p><strong>Who are you?</strong></p>
          <p>We are the Magic Money Tree team! We bring a cooperative mindset to the crypto-space (which has often been too individualistic), and we're passionate about increasing the diversity and accessibility of cypherspace. We build tools for groups who manage crypto-currency collectively. Our backgrounds are in open source software, hacking financial processes for radical collaboration, facilitating distributed communities, and building cooperatives. We currently have five team members spread across Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and Germany.</p>

          <p><strong>How can I get in touch?</strong></p>
          <p>You can find us on the #mmt channel on Secure Scuttlebutt, or email us....</p>
